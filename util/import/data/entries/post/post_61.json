Babi has been making it since she was a little girl. It's a family tradition.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Like most coffee cakes, this is not too sweet. There's no bitter or savory element here, just yummy goodness.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Oh, and you don't have to use blueberries, but we always do. Maybe once or twice we used raspberries. (Oooh, that sounds goooood!)</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Regardless of the berry you use though, this stuff doesn't last long. We sometimes have to make a second one for our guests because we snacked up the first. Oh well.
