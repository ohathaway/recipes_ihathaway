We got it out of one of the greatest cookbooks of all time, one that continues to be relevant even now as it continues to be updated regularly since 1936. Yes, it's Joy of Cooking. I'm not sure which edition we have, but we've had our copy for about 20'ish years.\n\nAs for the dish. What can I say? It's potatoes au gratin. Creamy, savory, cheesy. Mmmmm. Of course, this thing is so rich and bad for you in several ways that we only make it on Thanksgiving and at Christmas. Every year. For as long as I can remember.\n\n<!--WPRM Recipe 150-->\n<div class=\"wprm-fallback-recipe\">\n\t<h2 class=\"wprm-fallback-recipe-name\">Potatoes Gratin Dauphinois</h2>\n\t<img class=\"wprm-fallback-recipe-image\" src=\"https://recipes.ihathaway.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/download-150x150.jpeg\"/>\t<p class=\"wprm-fallback-recipe-summary\">\n\t\t<p>A classic potatoes au gratin for every holiday</p>\t</p>\n\t<div class=\"wprm-fallback-recipe-ingredients\">\n\t\t<ul><li>1 clove garlic</li><li>1 tbsp butter, softened</li><li>2 1/2 lbs potatoes, peeled and very thinly sliced</li><li>3 cups milk or half-and-half (these can be combined in any proportion)</li><li>1 tsp salt (don&#039;t leave this out)</li><li>1/4 tsp black pepper</li><li>1 pinch nutmeg</li><li>1 cup grated Gruyère or Fontinella cheese</li></ul>\t</div>\n\t<div class=\"wprm-fallback-recipe-instructions\">\n\t\t<ol><li><p>Preheat the oven to 350º</p></li><li><p>Rub a 12-inch gratin dish or shallow 3 qt baking dish with the garlic, then the butter</p></li><li><p>Add the rest of the ingredients except the cheese to a large sauce pan or Dutch oven</p></li><li><p>Bring to a gentle boil over medium heat</p></li><li><p>Cook until slightly thickened, about 5 minutes</p></li><li><p>Pour the mixture into the baking dish and press the top layer of potatoes down to submerge them</p></li><li><p>Sprinkle the cheese on top</p></li><li><p>Bake for 45 minutes to 1 hour</p></li></ol>\t</div>\n\t<div class=\"wprm-fallback-recipe-notes\">\n\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n<!--End WPRM Recipe-->",
