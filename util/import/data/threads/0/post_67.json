This is from the wonderful Spruce Eats website (I&#039;m not claiming credit for this recipe, just saving it for later reference)</p><p><a href=\"https://www.thespruceeats.com/chinese-garlic-sauce-for-stir-fries-4066674\">https://www.thespruceeats.com/chinese-garlic-sauce-for-stir-fries-4066674</a></p>",
